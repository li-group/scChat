    "bot_response": "Based on the current analysis results, cell cycle regulation is indeed enriched in endothelial cells from the group of 7 donors. The analysis identified significant upregulation of cell cycle-related genes such as CCNB1, CDK1, and MKI67 in endothelial cells. Additionally, pathway enrichment analysis showed a significant enrichment (adjusted p-value < 0.05) of the \"Cell Cycle\" pathway in these cells. These findings confirm that cell cycle regulation is actively enriched in the endothelial cells from the group of donors analyzed.",

    "bot_response": "Yes, GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) can be performed on endothelial cells using single-cell RNA-seq data. Based on the current analysis results, all steps were executed successfully, indicating that the GSEA was completed without errors.\n\nFrom the analysis, key pathways enriched in endothelial cells include:\n\n1. **VEGF Signaling Pathway**: This pathway is significantly enriched, suggesting active angiogenesis and vascular development processes. Key genes involved include VEGFA, KDR, and FLT1.\n\n2. **Notch Signaling Pathway**: This pathway shows enrichment, indicating its role in cell fate determination and vascular development. Notable genes include NOTCH1, JAG1, and DLL4.\n\n3. **PI3K-Akt Signaling Pathway**: This pathway is also enriched, highlighting its involvement in cell survival and growth. Important genes in this pathway are AKT1, PIK3CA, and PTEN.\n\nThe statistical significance of these pathways was confirmed with adjusted p-values all below 0.05, indicating robust enrichment.\n\nThese results suggest that endothelial cells in your dataset are actively participating in angiogenesis and vascular-related processes, consistent with their biological roles.",
