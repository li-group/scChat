    "bot_response": "Based on the current analysis results, there is no strong evidence to confirm that cell cycle regulation is enriched in Endothelial cells from the group of 7 donors. The enrichment analysis identified terms such as \"regulation of cell population proliferation\" (p-value: 0.001845) and \"regulation of cellular process\" (p-value: 0.001039), which are related but not specific to cell cycle regulation. Therefore, we cannot conclusively state that cell cycle regulation is enriched in these Endothelial cells.",
