[scvi-tools](https://scvi-tools.org/) (single-cell variational inference
tools) is a package for probabilistic modeling and analysis of single-cell omics
data, built on top of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) and
[AnnData](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

scvi-tools is part of the scverse project ([website](https://scverse.org), [governance](https://scverse.org/about/roles)) and is fiscally sponsored by [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/).

# Analysis of single-cell omics data

scvi-tools is composed of models that perform many analysis tasks across single- or multi-omics:

-   Dimensionality reduction
-   Data integration
-   Automated annotation
-   Factor analysis
-   Doublet detection
-   Spatial deconvolution
-   and more!

In the [user guide](https://docs.scvi-tools.org/en/stable/user_guide/index.html), we provide an overview of each model.
All model implementations have a high-level API that interacts with
[scanpy](http://scanpy.readthedocs.io/) and includes standard save/load functions, GPU acceleration, etc.

# Rapid development of novel probabilistic models

scvi-tools contains the building blocks to develop and deploy novel probablistic
models. These building blocks are powered by popular probabilistic and
machine learning frameworks such as [PyTorch
Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/) and
[Pyro](https://pyro.ai/). For an overview of how the scvi-tools package
is structured, you may refer to [this](https://docs.scvi-tools.org/en/stable/user_guide/background/codebase_overview.html) page.

We recommend checking out the [skeleton
repository](https://github.com/scverse/simple-scvi) as a
starting point for developing and deploying new models with scvi-tools.

# Basic installation

For conda,

```
conda install scvi-tools -c conda-forge
```

and for pip,

```
pip install scvi-tools
```

Please be sure to install a version of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) that is compatible with your GPU (if applicable).

# Resources

-   Tutorials, API reference, and installation guides are available in
    the [documentation](https://docs.scvi-tools.org/).
-   For discussion of usage, check out our
    [forum](https://discourse.scvi-tools.org).
-   Please use the [issues](https://github.com/scverse/scvi-tools/issues) to submit bug reports.
-   If you\'d like to contribute, check out our [contributing
    guide](https://docs.scvi-tools.org/en/stable/contributing/index.html).
-   If you find a model useful for your research, please consider citing
    the corresponding publication (linked above).
