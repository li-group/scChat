This protein is a reliable marker for pre-B cells but its expression diminishes during terminal B cell differentiation in antibody secreting plasma cells. The protein has two N-terminal extracellular Ig-like domains separated by a non-Ig-like domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a large C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. This protein forms a complex with several membrane proteins including complement receptor type 2 (CD21) and tetraspanin (CD81) and this complex reduces the threshold for antigen-initiated B cell activation. Activation of this B-cell antigen receptor complex activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signalling pathway and the subsequent release of intracellular stores of calcium ions. This protein is a target of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells used in the treatment of lymphoblastic leukemia. Mutations in this gene are associated with the disease common variable immunodeficiency 3 (CVID3) which results in a failure of B-cell differentiation and impaired secretion of immunoglobulins. CVID3 is characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia, an inability to mount an antibody response to antigen, and recurrent bacterial infections. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2020]",

Each Ig heavy chain has an N-terminal variable (V) region containing the antigen-binding site and a C-terminal constant (C) region, encoded by an individual C region gene, that determines the isotype of the antibody and provides effector or signaling functions. The heavy chain V region is encoded by 1 each of 3 types of genes: V genes (see MIM 147070), joining (J) genes (see MIM 147010), and diversity (D) genes (see MIM 146910). The C region genes are clustered downstream of the V region genes within the heavy chain locus on chromosome 14. The IGHM gene encodes the C region of the mu heavy chain, which defines the IgM isotype. Naive B cells express the transmembrane forms of IgM and IgD (see IGHD; MIM 1471770) on their surface. During an antibody response, activated B cells can switch to the expression of individual downstream heavy chain C region genes by a process of somatic recombination known as isotype switching. In addition, secreted Ig forms that act as antibodies can be produced by alternative RNA processing of the heavy chain C region sequences. Although the membrane forms of all Ig isotypes are monomeric, secreted IgM forms pentamers, and occasionally hexamers, in plasma (summary by Janeway et al., 2005).[supplied by OMIM, Aug 2010]",

The protein comprises two domains that are structurally and functionally distinct. The N-terminal 40kDa domain is located in the cytoplasm and acts as an attachment site for the red cell skeleton by binding ankyrin. The glycosylated C-terminal membrane-associated domain contains 12-14 membrane spanning segments and carries out the stilbene disulphonate-sensitive exchange transport of anions. The cytoplasmic tail at the extreme C-terminus of the membrane domain binds carbonic anhydrase II. The encoded protein associates with the red cell membrane protein glycophorin A and this association promotes the correct folding and translocation of the exchanger. This protein is predominantly dimeric but forms tetramers in the presence of ankyrin. Many mutations in this gene are known in man, and these mutations can lead to two types of disease: destabilization of red cell membrane leading to hereditary spherocytosis, and defective kidney acid secretion leading to distal renal tubular acidosis. Other mutations that do not give rise to disease result in novel blood group antigens, which form the Diego blood group system. Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO, Melanesian ovalocytosis) results from the heterozygous presence of a deletion in the encoded protein and is common in areas where Plasmodium falciparum malaria is endemic.

However, some Ca(2+) also enters the cell through the sarcolemma (plasma membrane). During relaxation, Ca(2+) is sequestered within the intracellular stores. To prevent overloading of intracellular stores, the Ca(2+) that entered across the sarcolemma must be extruded from the cell. The Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger is the primary mechanism by which the Ca(2+) is extruded from the cell during relaxation. In the heart, the exchanger may play a key role in digitalis action.

It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).
