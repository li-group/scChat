                "explanation": "The protein encoded by this gene is a leucine-rich repeat-containing receptor (LGR) and member of the G protein-coupled, 7-transmembrane receptor (GPCR) superfamily. The encoded protein is a receptor for R-spondins and is involved in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. This protein plays a role in the formation and maintenance of adult intestinal stem cells during postembryonic development. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2015]",
