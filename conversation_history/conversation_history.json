    "user_message": "How is the known cell type 'Regulatory T cells' distinguished from the 'Conventional memory CD4 T cells' population, which is characterized by markers like CD3D?",
    "bot_response": "The current analysis results indicate that both 'Regulatory T cells' and 'Conventional memory CD4 T cells' were not successfully identified in the dataset, as evidenced by the failed analyses. This means that specific markers and distinguishing features for these cell types were not detected or validated in the current dataset.\n\nIn general, 'Regulatory T cells' (Tregs) can be distinguished from 'Conventional memory CD4 T cells' by their expression of specific markers. Tregs typically express the transcription factor FOXP3, along with surface markers such as CD25 (IL2RA) and low levels of CD127 (IL7R). In contrast, 'Conventional memory CD4 T cells' are often characterized by the expression of CD45RO, along with CD3D, which is a common T cell marker.\n\nGiven the absence of these cell types in your analysis, it may be necessary to revisit the data processing steps or consider alternative methods for cell type identification, such as adjusting clustering parameters or using different marker genes for identification. Additionally, ensuring that the dataset has sufficient coverage and depth to detect these cell types is crucial.",
