    "bot_response": "To distinguish 'Regulatory T cells' from 'Conventional memory CD4 T cells', we can focus on specific markers and pathways that are characteristic of each cell type based on the available data.\n\n**Regulatory T Cells (Tregs):**\n- **Key Markers and Genes:** The differential expression analysis for Regulatory T cells shows significant upregulation of genes such as PDCD1 (FC=6.04), CXCR6 (FC=5.94), GZMK (FC=5.76), and CD3D (FC=4.47). While CD3D is a common T cell marker, the presence of PDCD1 (also known as PD-1) is more indicative of Tregs, as it is associated with immune regulation.\n- **Pathways:** Enrichment analysis highlights pathways such as Allograft Rejection (p=5.86e-10) and Interferon Gamma Response (p=4.91e-04), which are relevant to the immunosuppressive and regulatory functions of Tregs.\n\n**Conventional Memory CD4 T Cells:**\n- **Key Markers:** Typically, memory CD4 T cells are characterized by markers like CD45RO and CD62L, but these were not specifically analyzed or discovered in the current dataset. The failure to discover 'CD4-positive memory T cell' in the analysis limits direct comparison.\n- **Common Markers:** CD3D is also expressed in memory CD4 T cells, but without specific markers like CD45RO being analyzed, distinguishing based solely on CD3D is insufficient.\n\n**Distinguishing Features:**\n- **Regulatory T cells** are distinguished by their regulatory functions and expression of PDCD1, which is not typically upregulated in conventional memory CD4 T cells.\n- **Pathway Enrichment:** The pathways enriched in Tregs, such as Allograft Rejection and Interferon Gamma Response, further support their role in immune regulation, which is not a characteristic feature of conventional memory CD4 T cells.\n\nIn summary, while both cell types express CD3D, Regulatory T cells can be distinguished by the upregulation of PDCD1 and their involvement in specific regulatory pathways. The absence of specific data on conventional memory CD4 T cells in this analysis limits further direct comparisons.",
