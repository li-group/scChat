    "bot_response": "Based on the current analysis results, there is no evidence to confirm that cell cycle regulation is enriched in endothelial cells from the group of 7 donors. The semantic search for 'Cell cycle regulation' did not find any related terms in the enrichment analysis for endothelial cells. The significant terms identified in the enrichment analysis were related to processes such as cell adhesion, blood vessel morphogenesis, and angiogenesis, but not cell cycle regulation.",
