    "bot_response": "Based on the current analysis results, there is no evidence to confirm that cell cycle regulation is enriched in endothelial cells from the group of 7 donors. The enrichment analysis for endothelial cells did not identify any significant terms related to cell cycle regulation. The significant pathways and terms identified were primarily related to cell adhesion, blood vessel morphogenesis, and vasculature development. If you are specifically interested in cell cycle regulation, further targeted analysis may be required to investigate this aspect.",
