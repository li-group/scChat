    "user_message": "How is the known cell type 'Regulatory T cells' distinguished from the 'Conventional memory CD4 T cells' population, which is characterized by markers like CD3D?",
    "bot_response": "The current analysis results indicate that no new subtypes of T cells, including Regulatory T cells (Tregs) and Conventional memory CD4 T cells, were discovered. Additionally, several analyses related to these cell types failed, meaning specific differential expression or enrichment data for these populations is unavailable.\n\nHowever, based on established biological knowledge, Regulatory T cells (Tregs) and Conventional memory CD4 T cells can be distinguished by their expression of specific markers:\n\n1. **Regulatory T cells (Tregs):**\n   - **Key Marker:** FOXP3 is the hallmark transcription factor for Tregs, critical for their development and function.\n   - **Additional Markers:** CD25 (IL2RA) is often expressed at high levels, and CTLA4 is another marker associated with Tregs.\n\n2. **Conventional memory CD4 T cells:**\n   - **Key Marker:** These cells typically express CD45RO, a marker of memory T cells.\n   - **Additional Markers:** CD3D is a general T cell marker, but memory CD4 T cells are also characterized by the expression of CD4 and the absence of FOXP3.\n\nIn summary, while specific analysis results are not available, Tregs can be distinguished from Conventional memory CD4 T cells primarily by the presence of FOXP3 and CD25, while memory CD4 T cells express CD45RO and lack FOXP3.",
