    "bot_response": "Based on the current analysis results, there is no evidence to confirm that cell cycle regulation is enriched in Endothelial cells from the group of 7 donors. The enrichment analysis for Endothelial cells highlights significant terms related to cell adhesion, blood vessel morphogenesis, blood vessel development, vasculature development, and angiogenesis, but does not list cell cycle regulation among the significant terms. If you are specifically interested in cell cycle regulation, additional targeted analyses may be needed to explore this aspect further.",
