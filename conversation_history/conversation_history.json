    "bot_response": "The Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using the Hallmark gene sets for T cells has identified several significant pathways. Here are the key findings:\n\n1. **Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition**: This pathway is significantly enriched with a p-value of 2.26e-21.\n2. **TNF-alpha Signaling via NF-kB**: This pathway is also highly significant with a p-value of 4.07e-14.\n3. **Complement**: This pathway shows significant enrichment with a p-value of 3.99e-13.\n4. **Apoptosis**: This pathway is significant with a p-value of 2.79e-11.\n5. **Hypoxia**: This pathway is enriched with a p-value of 4.88e-10.\n\nThese results indicate that these pathways are highly active in T cells under the conditions analyzed. You can explore the interactive plots available in the UI for a more detailed visualization of these enrichment results.",
