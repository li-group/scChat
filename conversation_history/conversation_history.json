    "bot_response": "Based on the current analysis results, there is no evidence to confirm that cell cycle regulation is enriched in endothelial cells from the group of 7 donors. The semantic search for 'Cell cycle regulation' did not find any related terms in the enrichment analysis for endothelial cells. The significant terms identified in the enrichment analysis are primarily related to blood vessel morphogenesis, development, and cell adhesion, rather than cell cycle regulation.",
