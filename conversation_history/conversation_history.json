    "user_message": "Based on the following experimental metadata and data analysis capabilities, please provide a comprehensive answer to the question.\n\nThe answer should strongly rely on the analysis you get, instead of just the metadata.METADATA OF THE EXPERIMENT:\nSeven adult patients with newly diagnosed, MGMT-unmethylated, EGFRvIII-positive glioblastoma underwent a phase 1 study combining systemically infused EGFRvIII\u2010targeted CAR T cells with pembrolizumab. After surgical resection and hypofractionated radiation (40 Gy in 15 fractions), each patient received up to three cycles of CAR T cells (2 \u00d7 10^8 cells/dose) co-administered with anti-PD-1, followed by pembrolizumab monotherapy. Safety was monitored by dose-limiting toxicity criteria and clinical adverse\u2010event grading. Tumors were resected at radiographic progression (7\u2013179 days post-infusion), providing paired pre- and post-treatment specimens in three patients and post-treatment tissue in four. Data modalities included single-cell RNA sequencing and TCR sequencing on CD45-enriched cells, flow cytometry phenotyping of infusion products with a 30\u2010marker panel, quantitative PCR for CAR transgene detection, and bulk NGS assessment of EGFRvIII expression. Peripheral blood kinetics were tracked by CAR copies per \u03bcg DNA. Comparative analyses involved prior recurrent GBM CAR T trials. The design allowed dissection of CAR T-cell infiltration, phenotypic shifts in myeloid and T-cell subsets, and interferon-stimulated signatures correlating with outcomes.\n\nQUESTION:\nWhich CD8\u207a T cell clusters are marked as resident memory (ZNF683\u207a, ITGAE\u207a) vs exhausted (PDCD1\u207a, TOX\u207a)?",
    "bot_response": "Based on the current analysis results, we can identify CD8\u207a T cell clusters marked as resident memory and exhausted using specific gene expression markers.\n\nFor resident memory CD8\u207a T cells, typically characterized by the expression of ZNF683 (also known as Hobit) and ITGAE (CD103), there is no direct differential expression analysis data available in the current results. This suggests that either these markers were not significantly differentially expressed in the dataset or the analysis did not specifically focus on these markers for resident memory T cells.\n\nFor exhausted CD8\u207a T cells, characterized by the expression of PDCD1 (PD-1) and TOX, the differential expression analysis for CD8-positive exhausted T cells shows significant upregulation of several genes. Although PDCD1 and TOX are not explicitly listed in the top upregulated genes, the presence of other exhaustion-related genes such as CCL5, CD52, and IL32, which are involved in immune regulation and inflammation, supports the identification of exhausted T cell clusters.\n\nIn summary, while the current data provides evidence for exhausted CD8\u207a T cell clusters through the upregulation of exhaustion-related genes, there is a lack of specific data for resident memory markers ZNF683 and ITGAE. Further analysis focusing on these specific markers would be required to conclusively identify resident memory CD8\u207a T cell clusters.",

    "bot_response": "Based on the current analysis results, there is no increase in the size of the CD8\u207a exhausted T cell cluster in patient 1 (P1) after therapy. Both pre-treatment and post-treatment samples from P1 show 0 cells in the CD8-positive exhausted T cell cluster. Therefore, we can conclude that there is no detectable presence or increase of this cell type in P1 following the therapy.",
