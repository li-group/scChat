However, the current analysis results indicate that there are no GO enrichment analysis results available for visualization. Despite this, we have conducted a successful Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for T cells.\n\nThe GSEA results for T cells show significant enrichment in several terms, including:\n- Bone Marrow-cd8-positive, Alpha-Beta T Cell (p=1.69e-10)\n- Kidney-nk Cell (p=1.69e-10)\n- Skin-regulatory T Cell (p=2.17e-09)\n- Thymus-cd8-positive, Alpha-Beta Cytotoxic T Cell (p=2.17e-09)\n- Mammary-nk Cell (p=2.17e-09)\n\nThese results suggest significant enrichment in pathways related to CD8-positive T cells and regulatory T cells across different tissues.
