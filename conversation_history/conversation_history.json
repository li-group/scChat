    "bot_response": "The violin plot for T cells with the gene CD3D has been successfully generated and is available for viewing in the UI. CD3D is one of the top upregulated genes in T cells across several conditions, including Age-Related Macular Degeneration, Cataract, and Basal Laminar Drusen, with fold changes of 9.80, 7.96, and 10.50, respectively. This indicates a strong expression of CD3D in T cells, which is consistent with its role as a critical component of the T cell receptor complex. You can view the detailed expression distribution of CD3D in T cells through the interactive plot in the UI.",
