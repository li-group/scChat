    "bot_response": "The differential expression analysis (DEA) for microglial cells has been successfully conducted across various conditions. Here are the key findings:\n\n1. **P7 Pre Condition**: The top upregulated genes include FTL (FC=3.93), APOC1 (FC=3.49), and TMIGD3 (FC=3.33). A total of 100 upregulated genes were identified.\n\n2. **P1 Pre Condition**: The most upregulated genes are LINC01736 (FC=4.70), C1QB (FC=4.67), and C1QC (FC=4.45). Again, 100 upregulated genes were identified.\n\n3. **P6 Post Condition**: The top upregulated genes are CXCL10 (FC=1.34), AC131944.1 (FC=1.34), and APOC2 (FC=1.28), with a total of 100 upregulated genes.\n\n4. **P1 Post Condition**: APOE (FC=6.82), APOC1 (FC=6.61), and C1QC (FC=5.75) are among the most upregulated genes, with 100 upregulated genes identified.\n\n5. **P7 Post Condition**: The top upregulated genes include APOE (FC=5.22), C1QC (FC=5.03), and P2RY12 (FC=4.80), with 100 upregulated genes in total.\n\n6. **Bulk Analysis (All Conditions Combined)**: The top upregulated genes are SPP1 (FC=3.57), C1QC (FC=3.36), and C1QB (FC=3.34), with 100 upregulated genes identified.\n\nThese results highlight significant changes in gene expression in microglial cells across different conditions, with genes like APOE, C1QC, and SPP1 frequently appearing as upregulated across multiple conditions. These genes are often associated with immune response and inflammation, which are critical functions of microglial cells.",

Here are the key findings:\n\n1. **Biological Processes (GO_BP):**\n   - **Immune system process**: Highly significant with a p-value of 8.27e-22.\n   - **Defense response**: p-value of 3.22e-21.\n   - **Immune response**: p-value of 1.83e-20.\n   - **Regulation of immune system process**: p-value of 5.60e-20.\n   - **Response to biotic stimulus**: p-value of 1.26e-19.\n   - Total significant terms: 1286.\n\n2. **Cellular Components (GO_CC):**\n   - **Intracellular vesicle** and **cytoplasmic vesicle**: Both with a p-value of 1.69e-15.\n   - **MHC class II protein complex**: p-value of 6.82e-14.\n   - **Vesicle**: p-value of 6.82e-14.\n   - **MHC protein complex**: p-value of 1.44e-12.\n   - Total significant terms: 132.\n\n3. **Molecular Functions (GO_MF):**\n   - **MHC class II protein complex binding**: p-value of 2.35e-11.\n   - **MHC protein complex binding**: p-value of 2.15e-10.\n   - **Peptide binding**: p-value of 8.02e-09.\n   - **Protein-containing complex binding**: p-value of 3.98e-07.\n   - **Immune receptor activity**: p-value of 1.49e-06.\n   - Total significant terms: 118.\n\nThese results highlight the prominent role of microglial cells in immune-related processes and their involvement in antigen presentation, as indicated by the enrichment of MHC-related terms. This analysis underscores the importance of microglial cells in the immune defense mechanisms within the central nervous system.",
